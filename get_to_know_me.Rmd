Hi!

My name is Samina and I'm a second-year Master of Public Health (MPH) student at Columbia University. I'm learning to code this semester so that I can use data science to solve public health problems :)

About about me  
* I'm from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (home to North America's largest urban park, 22x larger than Central Park!)  
* My wallet is made out of pink duct tape  
* Hobbies: basketball, re-organizing the pantry, cooking  


Some shows I have really been enjoying recently:  
* The Great British Baking Show (Anna Beattie)  
* Insecure (Issa Rae, Larry Wilmore)  
* Beef (Lee Sung Jin)  
* Never Have I Ever (Mindy Kaling, Lang Fischer)  
* Kim's Convenience (Ins Choi, Kevin White)  
* On My Block (Lauren Iungerich, Eddie Gonzalez, Jeremy Haft)
